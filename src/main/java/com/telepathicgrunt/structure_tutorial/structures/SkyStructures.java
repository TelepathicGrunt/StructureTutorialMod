     * This is where extra checks can be done to determine if the structure can spawn here.
     * This only needs to be overridden if you're adding additional spawn conditions.
     *
     * Fun fact, if you set your structure separation/spacing to be 0/1, you can use
     * isFeatureChunk to return true only if certain chunk coordinates are passed in
     * which allows you to spawn structures only at certain coordinates in the world.
     *
     * Basically, this method is used for determining if the land is at a suitable height,
     * if certain other structures are too close or not, or some other restrictive condition.
     *
     * For example, Pillager Outposts added a check to make sure it cannot spawn within 10 chunk of a Village.
     * (Bedrock Edition seems to not have the same check)
     *
     * If you are doing Nether structures, you'll probably want to spawn your structure on top of ledges.
     * Best way to do that is to use getBaseColumn to grab a column of blocks at the structure's x/z position.
     * Then loop through it and look for land with air above it and set blockpos's Y value to it.
     * Make sure to set the final boolean in JigsawPlacement.addPieces to false so
     * that the structure spawns at blockpos's y value instead of placing the structure on the Bedrock roof!
     *
     * Also, please for the love of god, do not do dimension checking here.
     * If you do and another mod's dimension is trying to spawn your structure,
     * the locate command will make minecraft hang forever and break the game.
     * Use the biome tags for where to spawn the structure and users can datapack
     * it to spawn in specific biomes that aren't in the dimension they don't like if they wish.
