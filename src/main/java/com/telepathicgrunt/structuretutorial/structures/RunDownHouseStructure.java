     * checking here as you should've added this structure to the biomes you
     * wanted already with the biome load event.
     * 
     * Basically, this method is used for determining if the land is at a suitable height,
     * if certain other structures are too close or not, or some other restrictive condition.
     *
     * For example, Pillager Outposts added a check to make sure it cannot spawn within 10 chunk of a Village.

     * another mod's dimension is trying to spawn your structure, the locate
     * command will make minecraft hang forever and break the game.
     *
     * Instead, use the WorldEvent.Load event in StructureTutorialMain class.
     * If you check for the dimension there and do not add your structure's
     * spacing into the chunk generator, the structure will not spawn in that dimension!
